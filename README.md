# HCC_website_clone
A clone of the website for the church I attend. Harvester Christian Church (www.harvester.cc)

I want to clone websites, instead of follow projects given to me in freecodecamp.org (or the like) for a few reasons:

1.) I highly doubt there is a tutorial online on how to close my local churches website - so potential employers can feel confident I actually cloned it by doing the real job of a web developer.

2.) Due to the lack of help online, the struggle will be real, and therefore the learning will be far superior to other methods and I will be a much better developer at this stage of my career than average.

3.) A professional designed this site. If I can clone it, my confidence will go up. 

4.) I want my portfolio to be unique, expressing who I am as a person, my interests, hobbies, and passions. I don't want a snake game, or a rock paper scissors game - this portfolio will never have been seen by employers because it will be uniquely mine, like a fingerprint. I think that is far more attractive and is something I would look for when hiring an employee. 


Side note: I plan on giving video updates on a youtube channel that I will start named TheGoodNewsDev. That is where I will discuss the struggles, hurdles, achievements, and milestones on my jouney to learn web and software development. If you are a potential employer and you are reading this, please check out that channel which can be found by hovering over a project on my portfolio, exposing a button to visit the channel.

Thank you, and God bless.
